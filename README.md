# üï∏Ô∏è Amazon Product Tracker ‚Äì Backend

This is the backend for the Amazon Product Tracker app. It scrapes Amazon product data using Puppeteer with stealth and handles scheduled price tracking, image uploads to Cloudinary, and user authentication.

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the backend locally or deploy it to platforms like Render.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaghavBansal1211/Price-Tracker.git
cd Price-Tracker-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Local Development (Non-deploy)

To run the backend locally **without deploying**, follow these additional steps after installing dependencies:

```bash
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

This will download the necessary Chrome binary and create the `./.cache` directory required by Puppeteer.

Then start the backend:

```bash
node index.js
```

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying (Render/Production)

If you're deploying on Render or a similar service, use this build script(already included in the repo) to handle Puppeteer setup:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# exit on error
set -o errexit

# Install dependencies
npm install
# Uncomment this line if you need to build your project
# npm run build 

# Ensure the Puppeteer cache directory exists
PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=/opt/render/project/.cache/puppeteer
mkdir -p $PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR

# Install Puppeteer and download Chrome
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome

# Store/pull Puppeteer cache with build cache
if [[ ! -d $PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR ]]; then 
  echo "...Copying Puppeteer Cache from Build Cache"
  cp -R /opt/render/project/src/backend/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/ $PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR
else 
  echo "...Storing Puppeteer Cache in Build Cache"
  cp -R $PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR /opt/render/project/src/backend/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/
fi
```
